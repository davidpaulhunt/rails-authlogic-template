Best used with Rails >= 5.0.1 and Ruby >= 2.3.3

### Usage

```
$ rails new app -m https://github.com/davidpaulhunt/rails-authlogic-template/blob/master/template.rb
```

### Benefits
Quickly creates User and UserSession classes complete with signin/signout links and forms, flash messages, and password resets.

It's not made for production but as a way to get going locally when you want to prototype a new idea without writing something from scratch and without using something as verbose as Devise.
